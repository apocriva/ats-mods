# Worker Hotkeys

A simple mod for Against the Storm which adds some extra shortcut keys for some menus in the game.

Currently supports:
* Encyclopedia menu. (Hotkey for each tab.)

Requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx).

Extract `ExtraHotkeys` into the `BepInEx\plugins` folder in the Against the Storm main install folder. If this folder doesn't exist, run the game once with BepInEx installed to make it automatically.

After running the game once with the mod installed, `BepInEx\config\ExtraHotkeys.cfg` can be modified to set the desired hotkeys.
